Environmental Condition Monitoring is an all-in-one system developed as part of the [TEXTaiLES](https://textailes-eccch.eu/) toolbox which collects and sends data to a database for several environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and luminance. The current application is focused on monitoring environmental conditions in cultural heritage sites.
